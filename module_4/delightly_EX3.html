          <h3>5 Things Iâ€™ve Learned Since the Course Started</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Colors and color combinations mean different things in different cultures and that should be considered in design.</li>
                <li>Reading a screen is more exhausting on the eyes than reading paper because of the constant refresh.</li>
                <li>Even though it is more efficient to read long lines of text, people still prefer to read shorter lines of text.</li>
                <li>Reconstructed memories are different each time they are recalled and can make someone remember false details.</li>
                <li>People defend their ideas more when they are uncertain of them, which seems backwards to me but it is true.</li>
